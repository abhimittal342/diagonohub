<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>Back pain is a common reason for absence from work and for seeking medical treatment. It can be uncomfortable and debilitating.

It can result from injury, activity and some medical conditions. Back pain can affect people of any age, for different reasons. As people get older, the chance of developing lower back pain increases, due to factors such as previous occupation and degenerative disk disease.

Lower back pain may be linked to the bony lumbar spine, discs between the vertebrae, ligaments around the spine and discs, spinal cord and nerves, lower back muscles, abdominal and pelvic internal organs, and the skin around the lumbar area.

Pain in the upper back may be due to disorders of the aorta, tumors in the chest, and spine inflammation.</p>

<h1 >Causes</h1>
<p>The human back is composed of a complex structure of muscles, ligaments, tendons, disks, and bones, which work together to support the body and enable us to move around.

The segments of the spine are cushioned with cartilage-like pads called disks.

Problems with any of these components can lead to back pain. In some cases of back pain, its cause remains unclear.

Damage can result from strain, medical conditions, and poor posture, among others..</p>

<h1 >Symptoms</h1>
<p> The main symptom of back pain is an ache or pain anywhere in the back, and sometimes all the way down to the buttocks and legs.

Some back issues can cause pain in other parts of the body, depending on the nerves affected.

The pain often goes away without treatment, but if it occurs with any of the following people should see their doctor:
<ul class="reset">
   <li> weight loss</li>
   <li>  fever</li>
    <li> inflammation or swelling on the back</li>
    <li> persistent back pain, where lying down or resting does not help</li>
   <li>  pain down the legs</li>
   <li>  pain that reaches below the knees</li>
   <li>  a recent injury, blow or trauma to the back</li>
   <li>  urinary incontinence</li>
   <li>  difficulty urinating</li>
   <li>  fecal incontinence, or loss of control over bowel movements</li>
   <li>  numbness around the genitals</li>
 <li>numbness around the buttocks</li>
 </ul>

<h1 >Diagonsis</h1>
<pre>A doctor will usually be able to diagnose back pain after asking about symptoms and carrying out a physical examination.

An imaging scan and other tests may be required if:

    back pain appears to result from an injury
    there may be underlying cause that needs treatment
    the pain persists over a long period

An X-ray, MRI, or CT scan can give information about the state of the soft tissues in the back.

    X-rays can show the alignment of the bones and detect signs of arthritis or broken bones, but they may not reveal damage in the muscles, spinal cord, nerves, or disks.
    MRI or CT scans can reveal herniated disks or problems with tissue, tendons, nerves, ligaments, blood vessels, muscles, and bones.
    Bone scans can detect bone tumors or compression fractures caused by osteoporosis. A radioactive substance or tracer is injected into a vein. The tracer collects in the bones and helps the doctor detect bone problems with the aid of a special camera.
    Electromyography or EMG measures the electrical impulses produced by nerves in response to muscles. This can confirm nerve compression, which may occur with a herniated disk or spinal stenosis.

The doctor may also order a blood test if infection is suspected..</pre>

<h1 >Prevention</h1>
<p>The following factors are linked to a higher risk of developing low back pain:</p>
<ul>
 <li>   occupational activities</li>
 <li>   pregnancy</li>
 <li>   a sedentary lifestyle</li>
 <li>   poor physical fitness</li>
  <li>  older age</li>
 <li>   obesity and excess weight</li>
  <li>  smoking</li>
  <li>  strenuous physical exercise or work, especially if done incorrectly</li>
  <li>  genetic factors
  <li>  medical conditions, such as arthritis and cancer</li>
