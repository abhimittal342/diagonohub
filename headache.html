<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>A headache can be a sign of stress or emotional distress, or it can result from a medical disorder, such as migraine or high blood pressure, anxiety, or 
depression. It can lead to other problems. People with chronic migraine headaches, for example, may find it hard to attend work or school regularly. </p>

<h1 >Causes</h1>
<p> A headache can occur in any part of the head, on both sides of the head, or in just one location.

There are different ways to define headaches.

The International Headache Society (IHS) categorize headaches as primary, when they are not caused by another condition, or secondary, when there is a further
 underlying cause. .</p>

<h1 >Symptoms</h1>
<p> Headaches can radiate across the head from a central point or have a vise-like quality. They can be sharp, throbbing or dull, appear gradually or suddenly. They can last from less than an hour up to several days.

The symptoms of a headache depend to some extent on what type of headache it is.</p>

<p><strong>Tension headache:</strong> There may be general, mild to moderate pain that can feel like a band around the head. They tend to affect both sides of the head.</p>

<p><strong>Migraine headache: </strong>There is often a severe throbbing pain in one part of the head, often the front or the side. There may be nausea and vomiting, and the person may feel especially sensitive to light or noise.</p>

<p><strong>Cluster headaches:</strong> These can cause intense pain, often around one eye. They usually happen around a particular time of year, possibly over a period of 1 to 2 months..</p>

<h1 >Diagonsis</h1>
<p>A doctor will usually be able to diagnose a particular type of headache through a description of the condition, the type of pain, and the timing and pattern of attacks. If the nature of the headache appears to be complex, tests may be carried out to eliminate more serious causes.

Further testing could include:</p>
 <p>     .blood tests</p>
       <p>  .X-rays</p>
     <p> .brain scans, such as CT and MRI</p>
</pre>

<p>The WHO points out that headaches are often not taken seriously because they are sporadic, most headaches do not lead to death, and they are not contagious.</p>

<p>They call for more resources to be allocated for the treatment of headache disorders, because of the huge health burden they represent. </p>

<h1 >Treatment</h1>
<p>The most common ways of treating headaches are rest and pain relief medication.

Generic pain relief medication is available over the counter (OTC), or doctors can prescribe preventative medication, such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin receptor agonists, anti-epileptic drugs, and beta-blockers.

It is important to follow the doctor's advice because overusing pain relief medication can lead to rebound headaches. The treatment of rebound headaches involves the reducing or stopping pain relief medication. In extreme cases, a short hospital stay may be needed to manage withdrawal safely and effectively.</p>

<h1 >Home Remedies</h1>
<p> A number of steps can be taken to reduce the risk of headaches and to ease the pain if they do occur:</p>

    <p>1. Apply a heat pack or ice pack to your head or neck, but avoid extreme temperatures.</p>
  <p>2. Avoid stressors, where possible, and develop healthy coping strategies for unavoidable stress.</p>
  <p>3. Eat regular meals, taking care to maintain stable blood sugar.</p>

<p>A hot shower can help, although in one rare condition hot water exposure can trigger headaches. Exercising regularly and getting enough rest and regular sleep
 contributes to overall health and stress reduction. </p>
