<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>Episodes of extreme overeating are the hallmark of this illness, which is the most common eating disorder. People who struggle with it are usually overweight
 or obese -- male or female. In contrast with bulimia, this illness does not lead people to purge (vomit), fast, or over-exercise. It can develop at any age 
 but is often diagnosed in middle age. It can lead to type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.</p>

<h1 >Diagonis</h1>
<p>Most binge eaters hide their overeating, even from close family members, so getting a diagnosis can be difficult. One sign is a history of bingeing at least once weekly 
for the last 3 months. Diagnosis may also include a physical exam and a discussion of eating patterns, medical history, and family history.</p>

<h1 >Symptoms</h1>
<p>Many of us overeat from time to time; binge eating is different. People describe feeling out of control when they overeat. They may eat more quickly than 
usual during a binge. They may eat until they are painfully full, or binge when they aren't hungry. Many people with binge eating disorder say that stress, 
anxiety, depression, or boredom can trigger a binge.</p>

<h1 >Binge Eating Symptom: Guilt</h1>
<p>It's common for someone with binge eating disorder to feel guilty, ashamed, or depressed after a binge. This can lead to a vicious cycle in which bingeing
 causes emotional distress, and then emotional distress causes more bingeing. Guilt and shame cause many people with binge eating disorder to hide the behavior
 , which can make it harder to diagnose.</p>

<h1 >Treatment:Binge Eating Disorder</h1>
<p>Successful treatment may come from a combination of approaches. Talking with a therapist -- particularly cognitive behavioral therapy -- can help to change 
unhealthy eating habits and thinking patterns. Nutrition education, family counseling, and support groups can provide further help. Weight loss programs can 
also help get long-term control over binge eating.  If depression is an issue, your doctor may prescribe an anti-depressant medication. </p>

<h1 >Binge Eating Symptom: Weight Change</h1>
<p>It's not uncommon for someone with binge eating disorder to have weight fluctuations because of attempts to diet between bingeing episodes. But until the 
bingeing behavior is under control, weight loss efforts are unlikely to be successful in the long term.
